# Code of Conduct

0. [`mell-o-tron`](https://github.com/mell-o-tron) and [`Alex23087`](https://github.com/Alex23087) are thy BDFLs, and thou shalt have no other BDFLs, unless those appointed by the BDFLs.

1. Thou shalt bestow onto others this here sacred image whenever thou art able and to whomever thou wisheth, unless they are Richard M. Stallman (guy who GNU'd and the rest, Riccardo Stalluomo il Pazzuomo).

2. Remember and observe the day of $\pi$, unless thou art Steve Mould; in such case remember the day of $\tau$. In any case, and with no exception, remember the 21st night of September.

3. Honor the OSDev Forum and the Wayback Machine, unless they happen to enrage thee greatly.

4. Thou shalt not push changes that kill compatibility with the `Presario Almighty`, except if thou wisheth that thine balls (or suitable replacement, in case thou art devoid of spheres) be deleted by `mell-o-tron`.

5. Thou shalt not commit code that does not compile, otherwise thine proverbial balls shall be pruned. Once again, in case thine self be lacking of balls, any equivalently gruesome measure shall be employed.

6. Thou shalt [STEAL STEAL STEAL STEAL](https://youtu.be/xebSF8vRvZI) our code and put it in thy repo (but cite us plz. We shall choose a license at some point), except if you intend to do evil with it.

7. Thou shalt not bear. Thou shalt FROG! Unless... actually nevermind, always FROG!

8. Thou shalt not desire `x86_64`, unless thou joineth `perk`'s secret conspiracy against `mello` and the `Presario Almighty`.

9. Thou art me and I am him and we are thee and we are all together, except the Walrus. Goo goo g'joob.

The tablets with the rest of the commandments have fallen down and shattered. I am coming down the holy mountain, await further instruction.
